# Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because
# they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine
# something of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust
# power to do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will
# lead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust
# man to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest,
# which all natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the
# path of justice by the force of law. The liberty which we are supposing
# may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is
# said to have been possessed by Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the
# Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service
# of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made
# an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock.
# Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other
# marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he
# stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him,
# more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took
# from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met
# together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly
# report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having
# the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to
# turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became
# invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as
# if he were no longer present. He was astonished at this, and again
# touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made
# several trials of the ring, and always with the same result—when he
# turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he
# reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers
# who were sent to the court; whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the
# queen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and
# took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and
# the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be
# imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in
# justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he
# could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses
# and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison
# whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the
# actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would
# both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be
# a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks
# that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for
# wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is
# unjust. For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more
# profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have
# been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any
# one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any
# wrong or touching what was another’s, he would be thought by the
# lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him
# to one another’s faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a
# fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of this.
